# Lookup API in Business Accelerator Hub

## Introduction
For a start we will use a mock server to mimic the backend. This allows us to start developing our application without a fully configured and connected backend in place. Later on in this mission we will configure and use your SAP S/4HANA backend. 

In order for this mock server to be able to expose the required Business Partner API we need to provide the API specification. This specification can be found in the SAP Business Accelerator Hub.

So, as a preparation step, we will first Download the API Specification from Business Accelerator Hub.
